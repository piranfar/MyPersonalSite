Welcome to my personal research hub. I am a **Molecular Microbiologist** recognized as an **EB-1A recipient** for my work in clinical diagnostics and pathogen research. 

Based in **Jersey City, NJ**, I focus on bridging the gap between clinical microbiology and biological analysis. My work spans from investigating antimicrobial resistance in *Brucella* to modeling molecular interactions in drug-resistant pathogens.

### Core Expertise:
* **Medical Microbiology**: Over a decade of experience in pathogen isolation and molecular assays.
* **Data Science**: Proficient in Python for interactive data visualization and statistical analysis.
* **Bioinformatics**: Utilizing GROMACS and molecular dynamics for drug-resistance research.

> ### Vision Statement
> "In the modern era of microbiology, the microscope is no longer our only lens. By integrating computational data analysis with molecular techniques, we can decode pathogen behavior at a scale that was previously unimaginable."
