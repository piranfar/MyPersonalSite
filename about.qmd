## Professional Profile
I am a researcher specializing in **Medical Microbiology** and **Molecular Biology**. Currently based in **Jersey City, New Jersey**, I focus on the intersection of antimicrobial resistance, host-pathogen interactions, and computational biology. I am an **EB-1A recipient** (Alien of Extraordinary Ability), recognized for my contributions to the field of microbiology.

> ### Vision Statement
> "In the modern era of microbiology, the microscope is no longer our only lens. By integrating computational data analysis with molecular techniques, we can decode pathogen behavior at a scale that was previously unimaginable."
>
